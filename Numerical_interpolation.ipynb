    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to learn about numerical interpolation and why it is useful. We'll end up with something at the end of this notebook that we'll need for fitting our CMB and Large-Scale Structure data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "Now that we've got to grips with CAMB, we should be aware that it's pretty quick at computing all the observables that we're interested in. We've also looked at how to fit a straight line using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. If we wanted to fit some CMB data and extract some cosmological parameters, the obvious thing to do then would be to put CAMB inside our likelihood and run the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the cosmological parameters we are interested in; we would loop over our parameters of interest and for each set of parameters call CAMB to get our model predictions. We would then compare this to the data to compute the likelihood, and hence get the posterior samples for our cosmological parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one problem with this. Even though CAMB is fast it's not fast enough for fitting data in this way. For example, say a typical CAMB run takes 1 second to compute everything. Given the number of samples we generated in the previous notebook it would take over 10,000 seconds to fit our data, which is longer than we might want to wait for results. And this only gets worse if we realise we need more samples, or want to fit other data simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Solution\n",
    "A solution to this is to use numerical interpolation. We can pre-compute a set of observables using CAMB for the cosmological parameters we are interested in, and then every time we change the parameters and want to compute the likelihood, rather than running CAMB again, we can interpolate between the observables we already computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Interpolation is an extremely useful technique in all fields of astronomy and data analysis in general. It can be used to avoid solving complicated equations multiple times, or for solving equations that can't be inverted analytically. As an example of these, we'll start by building an interpolator for the comoving distance given a redshift. This equation normally involves a numerical integral to get the comoving distance given a redshift\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\chi(z) = c\\int^{z}_{0} \\frac{dz'}{H(z')},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "and it also can't be inverted easily to compute the redshift if we already know the distance. Numerical interpolation is faster than numerical integration and we can swap what we treat as the input and the output to invert the equation. In the exercises in this notebook we'll try to build and test our own linear interpolator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Interpolation\n",
    "Linear interpolation works by assuming that the function $y(x)$ between two known $(x,y)$ pairs is a straight line.\n",
    "Assuming $y=mx+c$, we can write\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{y-y_{0}}{x-x_{0}} = \\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $(x_{0},y_{0})$ and $(x_{1},y_{1})$ are the values we are interpolating between. In this case these are the comoving distances computed using CAMB. The above equation can be verified by substituting $y=mx+c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we rearrange the above equation we find\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y = y_{0}\\biggl(1-\\frac{x-x_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}\\biggl) + y_{1}\\biggl(\\frac{x-x_{0}}{x_{1}-x_{0}}\\biggl).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "This is what we need to code up to create our interpolator. An example algorithm is then:\n",
    "1. Compute and store $y_{i}(x_{i})$ for a suitably large range of $x_{i}$.\n",
    "2. For every value $y(x)$ we want to interpolate:\n",
    "    1. Find the values of $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$ in our list of $x_{i}$ that bound $x$, such that $x_{1}>x$ and $x_{0} < x$.\n",
    "    2. Retrieve the corresponding $y_{0}$ and $y_{1}$\n",
    "    3. Use these two pairs of values to compute $y$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "So, let's try coding this up for the comoving distance. We'll use CAMB to get the input comoving distances for our interpolator. I've already coded up part of this, but you'll need to use what you learnt last week to get the comoving distances given the input redshifts, and complete the interpolator."

We can improve on this by using higher-order interpolation schemes. Often, we get better accuracy using a so-called cubic-spline, which fits a special cubic polynomial between every pair of values. Rather than code this ourself, we can use the SciPy package to build our interpolator.\n",

    "#### 2D Linear interpolation\n",

For instance if we have a function z(x,y) we can interpolate in both x and y to return z without needing to evaluate this every time. This is exactly what we want for our model fitting purposes. We want to interpolate our observables (z), as a function of our two cosmological parameters.\n",

Let's turn the example above on it's head and look at interpolating the comoving distance for the two cosmological parameters we are interested in but for a single fixed redshift. In this case $x$ and $y$ are our cosmological parameters, whilst $z$ is our comoving distance. I've coded up some of this below. The code currently runs CAMB for $100$ $(10\\times 10)$ different combinations of $\\Omega_{b}$ and $w$ and stores these in a grid. I need you to use this grid of values to create a 2D interpolator, where we can put in any values of $\\Omega_{b}$ and $w$ and get the comoving distance.\n",
