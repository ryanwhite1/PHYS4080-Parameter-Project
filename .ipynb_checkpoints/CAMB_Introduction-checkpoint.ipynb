    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to learn a little about the code CAMB (Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background) originally written by Antony Lewis and Anthony Challinor. This code solves the relativistic Boltzmann equations at linear order given a cosmological model and then gives predictions for a range of cosmological observables. These include the full range of CMB anisotropies, interesting derived parameters and the low redshift matter power spectrum. Three common uses of this code are fitting CMB data (it was the main code used for interpreting data from the _Planck_ satellite), generating initial conditions for N-body simulations, and as a starting point for theoretical predictions of galaxy clustering. So it's a super useful code and one of the most widely used in cosmology!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go over how to install the code, choose some cosmological parameters, and generate some CMB and large scale structure data. From there, it's up to you to take the data from CAMB and plot the TT, TE and EE CMB power spectra and the matter power spectra for a few different cosmological models. For your assessment of this project you will want to include these plots in your talk and give a description of the physics behind how these power spectra change when you change the cosmological parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up the CAMB run\n",
    "So, now onto running CAMB. There are an enormous number of parameters in the code, but fortunately most of these can remain hidden and fixed. The parameters we might be interested in changing are:"
